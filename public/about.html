<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Aakash! I have a strong interest in technology and software development. I started with Python and later worked with Java, where I built a mini project using IntelliJ IDEA. Iâ€™ve also learned core Java concepts like methods, classes, inheritance, exception handling, and multithreading for my lab exams.

  I have explored data structures and algorithms, particularly trees and graphs, for my DSA lab tests.</p>
  <p>Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on full-stack development through an online course, where Iâ€™m learning to build web applications from scratch.
  
    Beyond web development, Iâ€™m considering expanding my knowledge in areas like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Ethical Hacking, DevOps with Docker & Kubernetes, and Mobile App Development (Android & Flutter).</p>
  
  <p>Iâ€™m still exploring which field excites me the most, but I enjoy solving problems and working on projects that help me apply what I learn.
  
  Right now, my goal is to build a solid foundation in web development while keeping an eye on emerging technologies. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, improve, and take on new challenges in the tech world! ðŸš€</p>
