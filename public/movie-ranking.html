<h3>Mersal</h3>
<p>As a vijay fan this is my one of his favourite movie, which deeply said about medical system of our nation. And it is a mass commercial entertainer.</p>
<h3>Sitaramam</h3>
<p>Love drama, film is about 'princess is loving a commoner', who is militant and who can do anything
    for his beloved ones.
